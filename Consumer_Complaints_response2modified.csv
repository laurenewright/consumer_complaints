Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document.

7/16/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"In XXXX, I and my ex-husband applied for a refinance & HELOC from Beneficial. The loans were granted. My ex-husband passed away XXXX XXXX. At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,IL,625XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/16/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1472017
