Consumer complaints and the frequency of recieving monetary relief

Code Louisville Python Project

You will need:
Jupyter Notebook
Numpy
Matplotlib

To get started download the data set from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database.
The data set was too large for me to upload to github.
