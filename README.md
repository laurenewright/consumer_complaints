# Results Summary

* Consumer complaints and the frequency of receiving  monetary relief

* Code Louisville Python Project

* You will need: Jupyter Notebook Numpy Matplotlib Pandas

* My question was: Which state had the highest amount of consumer complaints and which state recieved the most closed with monetary relief responses from companies.

* I isolated the reponses from the original dataset into one file and the monetary reponses by state into another file and sorted them in descending order by reponses. By sheer number of complaints and monetary responses California definitely won out, but that's not surprising given the population size of California.

* To go further with this project after class it would be interesting to see this data laid out after adjusted for population size.
